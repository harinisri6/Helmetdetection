# Helmetdetection
Detection of helmet violations is important for riders safety.The proposed YOLO v2 architecture yields better experimental results compared with traditional algorithms We use two reference lines to detect if a vehicle is moving or not. For helmet, we use YOLO architecture, It is regularized version of multilayer perceptions and it has 24 convolution layers and 2 fully connected layers and 5 max-pooling layers. Frames are given as input to the YOLOv2. It compares the giveninput image with the trained dataset. It assigns a neural network and splits up the image into such regions. At the output, images with required class along with the confidence of detection through bounding box and probability value is obtained.Bounding boxes with a probability of 0.7 are classified as wearing a helmet while others are not wearing Helmet.Prediction of helmet is shown below:
